## What is This Project?
This is the first project I've completed. It is a game of Tictac toe.
&nbsp;

## Issues I Encountered
As it was my first project, it took me 8 hours to complete.

I struggled for about 1 and a half of them to figure out an issue: No matter how many times O won, the points always went to X.

Went through the code many times (it was only a small project imagine a larger one... Big yikes).

Figured out the issue was that I used a ['] quote mark instead of a [`] backtick.
